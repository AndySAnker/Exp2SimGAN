# Getting started
Follow these step if you want to train Exp2SimGAN and predict with Exp2SimGAN locally on your own computer.

## Install requirements
See the [install](/install) folder. 

## Train model
To train your own DeepStruc model simply run:
```
python train.py
```
A list of possible arguments can be found in the following files:
- [base options](/options/base_options.py)
- [train options](/options/train_options.py)

## Predict
To predict a MMNP using DeepStruc or your own model on a PDF:
```
python predict.py
```
A list of possible arguments can be found in the following files:
- [base options](/options/base_options.py)
- [test options](/options/test_options.py)
