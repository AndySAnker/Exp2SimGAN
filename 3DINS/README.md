# Exp2SimGAN - 3D example

In this folder we have gathered files to achieve the 3D results in the paper.

The data to train the algorithm is deposited at Zenodo - https://zenodo.org/record/7308423#.Y2zgoOzML0o:
- dimer_140meV_60x60x60.npy
- goodenough_140meV_60x60x60.npy

and experimental data:
- exp_data.npy
